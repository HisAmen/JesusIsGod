<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Throughout this documentation you will notice how the names for God in Hebrew, especially in the Old Testament, are always inconsistent. The writer can speak of the same person but use a completely different word to refer to him. For example, sometimes the writer might use the word &ldquo;Adonai&rdquo; but then he would call the exact same person to whom he is referring to &ldquo;Yehova&rdquo;. However, all of this is explained in later explanations.</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Before we go into the explanations and verses, Hebrews had used various different names for God, some words like YHWH were not even pronounced by the prophets in the Old Testament consistently, because of how Holy his name was. Instead the names like Adonai were used in its places. However, these variations don&rsquo;t imply a different being but reflects the richness and layered meaning of God&rsquo;s names in Hebrew.</span></p>

<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">The evidence from the Greek texts supports the doctrine of the Trinity and Jesus as God incarnate. Which should make sense, given that Jesus Christ was fully revealed in the New Testament, while few details about him were told in the Old Testament, in places like Isiah 53 or Zechariah 12:10.</span><span class="C9DxTc "><br /></span></p>

<strong><span class="C9DxTc ">Common Disagreement and Fault Exposed.</span></strong></div>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Claim:</span><span class="C9DxTc ">&nbsp;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses argue that Jesus is the &ldquo;firstborn of creation,&rdquo; meaning He is a created being and not God.</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Biblical reference often cited:</span><span class="C9DxTc "><br /></span><span class="C9DxTc ">Colossians 1:15 &ndash; &ldquo;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Explanation Including Usage of Greek:</span><span class="C9DxTc "><br /></span><span class="C9DxTc ">The Greek word &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;ό&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; (prōtotokos) means &ldquo;firstborn,&rdquo; primarily conveying rank, status, or preeminence rather than &ldquo;first created.&rdquo; In Jewish culture, the firstborn son held a special position of authority and inheritance rights(e.g., Exodus 4:22, Psalm 89:27). When the New Testament describes Jesus as &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;ό&tau;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; &pi;ά&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf; &kappa;&tau;ί&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf; (&ldquo;firstborn of all creation,&rdquo; Colossians 1:15), it speaks of His preeminent status over creation, not that He was the first created being.</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Critical</span><span class="C9DxTc ">:If the New Testament intended to express that Jesus was created, it would likely use a different form such as &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;ό&kappa;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; (prōtoktistos)&mdash;a rare but theoretically possible meaning &ldquo;first created.&rdquo; However, this term does not appear in the Scriptures. Instead, words related to &kappa;&tau;ί&zeta;&omega; (ktizō), meaning &ldquo;to create,&rdquo; or nouns like &kappa;&tau;ί&sigma;&mu;&alpha; (ktisma) (&ldquo;a created thing&rdquo;) would be used to denote creation.</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">Also, an early church Father,&nbsp;</span><span class="C9DxTc ">Clement of Alexandria</span><span class="C9DxTc ">, pointed out the following in his commentary:</span></p>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr"><span class="C9DxTc ">&ldquo;</span><span class="C9DxTc ">He [Christ] is called &lsquo;firstborn&rsquo; not because He is the first thing created, but because He is the preeminent One, the heir of all things; for to be &lsquo;firstborn&rsquo; is a title of dignity and authority, not of origin or creation.</span><span class="C9DxTc ">&rdquo; - Clement of Alexandria, The Stromata (Miscellanies), Book 5, Chapter 14.</span></p>

<strong><span class="C9DxTc ">Closing.</span></strong></div>
<p class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="C9DxTc ">It is very clear that Jesus Christ is being referenced both directly and in indirect ways as being what everyone would call or understand as being God. There&rsquo;s no workaround for this. And, since men who wrote God&rsquo;s word were inspired by the Holy Spirit, it is safe to assume that was the Lord&rsquo;s intention.</span></p>
